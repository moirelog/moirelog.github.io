## Manually Trigger a Build

<Steps>

1. Go to your Forked repository

2. Click the **Actions** tab at the top

3. Find the **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow on the left

4. Click the **Run workflow** button on the right

5. Select the `main` branch and click the green **Run workflow** button

</Steps>

## View Build Status

The build process usually takes 1-3 minutes. You can click on the running workflow to view details. Here is what the statuses mean:

| Status | Icon | Meaning |
|------|------|------|
| In progress | 🟡 | Building |
| Success | ✅ | Build Successful |
| Failure | ❌ | Build Failed |

:::tip[Succesful Build Indicator]
When you see a green ✅ for all steps, the build was successful!
:::

## Access Your Website

After a successful build, you can access your website at the following address:

```
https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/
```

For example, if your GitHub username is `aeris` and the repo name is `moire`:

```
https://aeris.github.io/moire/
```

:::note[First Access]
It may take a few minutes for the deployment to take effect after the first run. If you see a 404 error, wait a moment and try again.

## Common Issues

### Build Failed?

If Actions shows a red ❌:

- Click the failed workflow to view the detailed logs
- Check if GitHub Actions permissions are correctly enabled
- Check if the "Build and deployment" Source is set to "GitHub Actions"

For more help, please see the [Troubleshooting](/en/troubleshooting/) chapter.

## Congratulations! 🎉

If you can successfully access your website, the deployment is complete!

Next, we need to configure the iOS Shortcut so you can sync notes from Apple Notes.
