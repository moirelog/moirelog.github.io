This chapter will guide you through the deployment of your Moire website, including Forking the repository, enabling Actions, configuring Pages, and generating a Token.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

## Step 2: Enable Actions

:::danger[Crucial Step]
Forked repositories **disable** GitHub Actions by default. You must enable them manually, otherwise the website will not build automatically.
:::

<Steps>

1. Go to your Forked repository

2. Click the **Actions** tab at the top

3. Click the green button: **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**

</Steps>

## Step 3: Configure Pages

:::danger[Crucial Step]
You must set the Pages build source to GitHub Actions, otherwise deployment will fail.
:::

<Steps>

1. On the **Settings** page, find **Pages** in the left menu

2. Under "Build and deployment", select **GitHub Actions** for **Source**

3. No other configuration is needed; you can return after this

</Steps>

## Step 4: Generate a Token

You need to generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) so the Shortcuts can upload notes to your repository.

<Steps>

1. Open [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)

2. Click **Generate new token**

3. Fill in the Token info:
    - **Token name**: `Moire Sync` (or any name)
    - **Expiration**: Recommended to choose 90 days or longer
    - **Repository access**: Select **Only select repositories**, then choose your Forked Moire repository

4. Configure permissions under **Permissions**:

    | Permission | Level | Description |
    |------|------|------|
    | **Contents** | Read and write | For uploading note files |
    | **Workflows** | Read and write | For triggering build processes |

5. Click **Generate token**

6. **Copy and save** the generated Token

    :::caution[Token is only shown once]
    The Token is only shown once after generation. Please copy and save it immediately for upcoming configuration steps. If lost, you will need to regenerate it.
    :::

</Steps>

## Token Format Description

Fine-grained PAT format looks like this:

```
github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

:::tip[Distinguishing Token Types]
- Starts with `github_pat_`: Fine-grained PAT (Recommended)
- Starts with `ghp_`: Classic PAT (Legacy)

It's recommended to use a Fine-grained PAT for more granular permissions and better security.
:::

## Next Steps

After generating the Token, let's verify if the deployment was successful!
