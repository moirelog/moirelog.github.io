description: How to sync new features and fixes from Moire

Since Moire is deployed by **Forking**, you will need to manually sync with the upstream code whenever you want new features or bug fixes for the website. Updates related to Shortcuts can be ignored.

## Method 1: Using the GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

This is the simplest method and does not require using the command line.

<Steps>

1. Open your GitHub repository page (e.g., `yourname/moirelog.github.io`).

2. Find the **Sync fork** button above the file list.

3. Click **Update branch**.

</Steps>

If the button shows "This branch is up to date," it means your code is already up to date.

## Method 2: Using the Command Line

If you are comfortable with Git, you can also perform the merge locally.

<Steps>

1. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/moirelog/moire.git
   ```

2. Fetch updates:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. Merge into your local main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

4. Push to your repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

</Steps>

## Considerations

- **Configuration File**: Updates usually do not modify your `moire.config.ts`, but handle with care if you encounter conflicts.
- **Custom Modifications**: If you have modified core system code (such as page layouts), merging may result in conflicts that require manual resolution.
