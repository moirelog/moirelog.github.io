To let Moire know which notes need to be synced, we need to create a dedicated folder in Apple Notes.

## Create the Moire Folder

<Steps>

1. Open the Apple Notes app.

2. Create a new folder under the **iCloud** section.

3. Name the folder **Moire** (or any name you prefer).

4. Done!

</Steps>

:::caution[Important: Binding the Shortcut to the Folder]

Since folder bindings in Shortcuts are stored as UUIDs rather than names, you need to re-bind the folder once.
:::

Please follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Open the Shortcuts app.
2. Find **Moire: Sync Notes to Github** and right-click to edit.
3. Find the step "Find all notes".
4. Click on "Folder" in the filter criteria and select the folder you just created.

</Steps>

## Why Need a Dedicated Folder?

### Better Organization

A dedicated folder allows you to:
- ✅ Clearly know what content will be made public
- ✅ Better manage blog posts
- ✅ Avoid accidental operations

:::tip[Best Practice]
Only sync content in the **Moire** folder; keep other personal notes private.
:::




## Folder Location

Ensure the Moire folder is under the **iCloud** section, not "On My iPhone".

```
📁 iCloud
  └── 📁 Moire  ← Create it here
  
📁 On My iPhone  ← Not here
```


## Start Creating

Once the folder is created, you can start writing notes in it!

### Writing Tips

- 📝 Use Markdown syntax (bold, italic, links, etc.)
- 🖼️ You can insert images (up to 1 image per note)
- 🏷️ Use `#tags` to categorize content
- ⚠️ Avoid unnecessary spaces at the beginning or end of titles or body text.

### Example Note

## Deleting a Note

To remove a synced note from your blog, simply add `[DEL]` to the note's title and sync again.

For example, change the title from:
```
My First Blog Post
```
to:
```
[DEL] My First Blog Post
```

The note will be removed from your blog on the next sync.

## Next Steps

Now that the folder is set up, finally we need to configure automation so your notes sync automatically when you close the app.

import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<LinkCard
  title="Automation"
  description="Set up automatic sync when closing Notes"
  href="/en/shortcuts/automation/"
/>
