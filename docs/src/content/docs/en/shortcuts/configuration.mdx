## Configuration Example

Complete configuration example:

| Field | Value |
|------|------|
| User | `aeris` |
| Repo | `moire` |
| Token | `github_pat_abc123...` |

Once filled, these configurations will be saved within the Shortcut's dictionary.

## FAQ

### Do I need to configure this on every device?

No. Shortcut configurations **will** sync across devices. If you use Moire on multiple devices (iPhone + iPad), you do not need to repeat the configuration.

## Next Steps

Once configured, we need to create a dedicated folder in Apple Notes.

import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
