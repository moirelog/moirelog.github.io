**Moire** is a lightweight publishing tool that syncs your Apple Notes to your personal website.


## What is Moire?

With Moire, you can:
- 📝 **Write in a familiar environment** - Use the native Apple Notes app
- 🔄 **Instant sync** - Trigger site updates immediately after closing a note
- 🎨 **Personalized appearance** - Choose from a variety of beautiful themes
- 🔒 **Full data control** - All content is stored in your own GitHub repository

## Core Features

### Native Experience First

Many blogging tools require you to install specialized writing software, learn new editors, or log into web backends. Moire's approach is simple—just use the native Notes app on your iPhone/iPad/Mac.

### Data Ownership

Your notes are not stored on any third-party servers. All content is stored in Markdown format in your own GitHub repository, so you can export, back up, or migrate at any time.

### Low Running Cost

Moire utilizes GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages (or Vercel), typically eliminating the need for paid servers.
