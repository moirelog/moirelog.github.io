**Moire** is a serverless blog engine that syncs your Apple Notes to your personal website.


## What is Moire?

With Moire, you can:
- 📝 **Write in a familiar environment** - Use the native Apple Notes app
- 🔄 **Automatic sync** - Automatically publish to your site after closing a note
- 🎨 **Personalized appearance** - Choose from a variety of beautiful themes
- 🔒 **Full data control** - All content is stored in your own GitHub repository

## Core Philosophies

### Native Experience First

Many blogging tools require you to install specialized writing software, learn new editors, or log into web backends. Moire is different—you just use the native Notes app on your iPhone/iPad/Mac.

### Data Ownership

Your notes are not stored on any third-party servers. All content is stored in Markdown format in your own GitHub repository, so you can export, back up, or migrate at any time.

### Zero Server Cost

Moire utilizes GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages (or Vercel), eliminating the need to purchase or maintain servers. It's completely free.
